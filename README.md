# Smart-Sensing-for-IoT-IR-Touch-detection-smIRtouch-
Prototype for sensing touch on a 1ft x 1ft to 2ft x 2ft surface, using Infrared based active sensing.

We planned to use IR sensors to track movement of a single pointing object on asurface. Basic idea is to make a system where we can mimic writing some patterns (e.g., geometrical shapes, alphabets) that the IR sensing system can identify and decode
